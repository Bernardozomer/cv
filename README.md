# Bernardo Zomer â€” Curriculum Vitae

A small repository that stores the source for my CV as a TeX document and publishes compiled PDFs via GitHub Actions.

You can also access Releases from this repository's GitHub UI by clicking "Releases" in the sidebar or the "Releases" link under the repository name.

## What this repo provides

- TeX source for the CV (root TeX file in the repository).
- Automated CI: a GitHub Actions workflow compiles the PDF and attaches it to a release when a new tag is pushed.
- `CHANGELOG.txt` with release notes for the most recent versions.
